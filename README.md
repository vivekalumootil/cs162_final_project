## 3. Model weights link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Uzaz6MuM2SL0o1nyV0ZR8DBwUVc6fST9/view?usp=sharing
## 3. After downloading the zip file from Google Drive, move it to the working space and unzip. There should be a directory containing the weights and config in the working space.
## 4. To run the model, do `python3 submission.py [path to .jsonl file]`. For example, `python3 submission.py arxiv_chatGPT.jsonl` if `arxiv_chatGPT.jsonl` is in this directory
## 5. The output is the statistics when evaluating the model on this dataset
